Each entry in the table represents a distinct hypothesis evaluated based on a comprehensive range of factors. The inclusion of a "killer effect" notes a standout property of each material that could contribute to its success in thermoelectric applications, paralleling how certain properties make perovskites effective in photovoltaics. The final column indicates whether the hypothesis is retained or newly proposed, reflecting any changes or adaptations to meet new research objectives.
